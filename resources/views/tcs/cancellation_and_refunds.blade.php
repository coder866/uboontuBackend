            <strong>Cancellation and Refunds</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the Vendors/Service Provider:
        </p>
        <p>
            Uboontu and its representatives reserve the sole right to cancel your order
            in the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <p>
            (i) in the event of the designated address falling outside the delivery
            zone offered on our platform;
        </p>
        <p>
            (ii) failure to contact you by phone or email at the time of confirming the
            order placement;
        </p>
        <p>
            (iii) failure to deliver your order due to lack of information, direction
            or authorization from you at the time of delivery;
        </p>
        <p>
            (iv) unavailability of all the items ordered by the customer at the time of
            booking the order; or
        </p>
        <p>
            (v) failure due to reasons beyond our control or attributable to the
            Vendor.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the unlikely event that you deliver a wrong item to the customer, he/she
            can reject the delivery of the wrong item and you will have to fully refund
            the online payment made in advance (for the missing item) within 14 days.
            If you can do only a partial delivery (as a few items might not be
            available), your restaurantâ€™s staff should inform the customer or propose a
            replacement for the missing items.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for wrong or partial delivery from your end. The
            issue has to be settled directly with the customer. If you regularly follow
            practices such as wrong or partial delivery, even after giving regular
            warnings and improvement opportunities, your account will be removed or
            blocked from continuing to serve through Uboontu.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the Customer:
        </p>
        <p>
            You must notify the participating Vendors/Service Provider immediately if
            you decide to cancel your order, preferably by phone, and quote your order
            number. If the Vendors/Service Provider accepts your cancellation, no
            cancellation fee applies. If the refuses cancellation, (e.g. preparation of
            order placed by you has been completed and/or delivery personnel has
            already been dispatched), we will not be able to refund any order, which
            has been already dispatched.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, you shall not be entitled to cancel your order once you
            have received confirmation of the same from the Uboontu. Usually, this is
            within 5 minutes of placing an order.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cancellation was made in time and once the Vendors/Service Provider
            has accepted your cancellation, we will refund or re-credit your debit or
            credit card/mpesa with the full amount within 14 days which includes the
            initial delivery charge (where applicable) which you paid for the delivery
            of the Goods or the Services, as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may cancel a contract/order if the product is not available for any
            reason. We will notify you if this is the case and return any payment that
            you have made.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in the unlikely event of an item on your order being unavailable,
            we will contact you on the phone number provided to us at the time of
            placing the order and inform you of such unavailability. In such an event
            you will be entitled to cancel the entire order and shall be entitled to a
            refund in accordance with our refund policy.
            <br />
            In the unlikely event that the Participating Vendors/Service Provider
            delivers a wrong item, you have the right to reject the delivery of the
            wrong item and you shall be fully refunded for the missing item/order
            within 14 days by the restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the Participating Vendors/Service Provider can only do a partial
            delivery (as a few items might not be available), its staff should inform
            you or propose a replacement for the missing items. We are not responsible
            for wrong or partial delivery. The issue has to be settled directly with
            the Participating Restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can register a complaint with us and if we have similar complaints from
            other users, Uboontu will ensure that such practices are not followed. Any
            Vendors/Service Provider found continuously following such practices, even
            after giving regular warnings and improvement opportunities, the
            Vendors/Service Provider will be removed or blocked from continuing to
            serve through Uboontu.
        </p>

            Cancellation Policy - Delivering &amp; Drivers
        </p>
        <p>
            As an independent contractor, you are able to choose whether to make
            yourself available to take a trip request sent to you by Uboontu, or to
            cancel an allocated booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            However we strongly recommend you go offline when you are not available to
            undertake trips. Uboontu reserves the right to enforce a breach of your
            contractual agreements or restrict access to the platform if you are found
            to be in breach of the cancellation policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without limitation, Uboontu considers the following cancellation behaviours
            to be in breach of the Services Agreement:
        </p>
        <p>
            - refusing to complete a trip for a rider based on their intended
            destination
            <br />
            - refusing to complete a trip for your rider based on the fare multiple
            applied by Uboontu Dynamic Pricing
            <br />
            - refusing to complete a trip for your rider for any reason that would be
            in breach of relevant discrimination laws and the conditions set out in
            your Private Hire Driver licence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of evidence of committing or intending to commit such behaviour
            include:
        </p>
        <p>
            - contacting a rider by phone and asking for the rider's destination before
            having arrived at the pick-up location.
            <br />
            - once aware of the destination, cancelling the ride, explicitly asking the
            rider to cancel the ride or behaving in an obstructive way to the natural
            flow of a trip in order to encourage the rider to cancel the trip.
            <br />
            - systematic and/or persistent cancellation of trips.
            <br />
            - not accepting guide dogs or any other service animal caring for disabled
            people
            <br />
            - refusing to complete a trip due to a discriminatory reasons, such as your
            rider's disability, gender, race or sexuality (for example)
