        <strong>What we do with the information we gather</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a
        better service, and in particular for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How we use cookies</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your
        computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie
        helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
        site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.
        The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and
        dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This
        helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our App in order
        to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for
        statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better App, by enabling us to
        monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no
        way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other
        than the data you choose to share with us.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking
        full advantage of the App.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Links to other Apps</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Our App may contain links to other Apps of interest. However, once you have
        used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any
        control over that other App. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the
        protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting
        such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You
        should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the
        App in question.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Controlling your personal information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal
        information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        </li>
        <li>
            Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the App, look for the box
            that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to
            be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for
            direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by
            writing to us.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <br />
        We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third
        parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We
        may use your personal information to send you promotional information about
        third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that
        you wish this to happen.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may request details of personal information which we hold about you
        under the Data Protection Act 1998.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or
        incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above
        address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.
